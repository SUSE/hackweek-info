# HackWeek: Learn | Combine | Share

HackWeek is a SUSE way of [Hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon),
which is usually one full week long. This time it's actually six days,
overlaping one day with [openSUSE conference](https://events.opensuse.org/)
in NÃ¼rnberg.

## Who | When | How

* Anyone at SUSE can participate, but we also encourage the community to join
  us too - in a team or alone, whatever works for you
* 24th June - 1st July 2016
* Depending on your local conditions, but basically you just come to work,
  look around, and start hacking

## HackWeek Theme

HackWeek #14 is a bit special, this time we have several suggested themes:

* [NFV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_function_virtualization) - Network
  function virtualization
* Cloud
* Storage
* Orchestration
* ... and obviously their combinations or in combination with other current
  SUSE solutions

## Current Projects

All current projects can be found at
[HackWeek Pages](https://hackweek.suse.com/14/projects)
but you are kindly asked to create new projects there as well.

## Create New Project

You have a great idea what could be done, but you just have two hands? You have
a plenty of great ideas, but you can just work on two of them in parallel? You
are looking for contributors? Anything else? Just go to the
[HackWeek Page](https://hackweek.suse.com/14/projects/new) and file it there.
Obviously, even if you want to work on a project just yourself, it's usually
a good idea to file it there - maybe someone could point you to more
information they know, maybe their comment could bring even a better idea.
Who knows?

## Communication

If you have anything to share with others, share it. Talk to people :)

For a specific project, it's usually good idea to use a specific communication
channel, but a good starting point could be IRC at `irc.freenode.net`,
channel `#hackweek` (or `#suse` as a fallback).

HackWeek organizers also listen to you at mailing-list `hackweek\Q/suse.de`.

## Sharing

We encourage you to share details of your project. Blog about it, tweet about
it, chat about it. Even a small talk in the kitchen can help you find some
hardware or contributors.

## Open Jobs | Help Needed!

We are looking for volunteers

* **Thunder Organizer:** Also known as Thor in Nordic Mythology.
  Someone who would organize and encourage people for
  giving [lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) at
  their location
* **Journalist:** Someone who would write daily blogs about HackWeek in general,
  about projects in progress, about people ...

## FAQ

#### So, what is this HackWeek thing?
You like being an engineer, you like hacking, and your head is brimming with
lots of great ideas that would make a difference - if you only had a stretch
of time without product development, bugs, and meetings.

This is what hackweek is about. Giving you one week to do exactly that - work
on a great idea, start a new software project, contribute to some upstream project,
build something new out of existing SUSE stuff... anything.

#### Really anything?
Well, almost.  Teaching yourself how to Hoola-Hoop may be fun, but
it's a bit outside the scope. SUSE HackWeek should be about hacking,
and it should be relevant to SUSE in some way.

#### I have no idea what to do.
Get inspired by the HackWeek Theme or go directly to
[HackWeek Pages](https://hackweek.suse.com/14/projects) and find a project that
you like. Talk to your team members, or people who share your interest in
coding - working on a joint project for a week can be great fun!
